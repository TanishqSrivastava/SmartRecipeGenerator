Smart Recipe Generator
======================

What is this?
Smart Recipe Generator helps you discover recipes from ingredients you already have. Type your ingredients or upload a photo of them, and the app suggests suitable recipes with steps and nutrition. You can filter by time and difficulty, set dietary preferences (like vegetarian or gluten‑free), change serving sizes, and save or rate your favorites.

Who is it for?
- Home cooks looking to reduce food waste by using what’s on hand
- Beginners who want clear steps and simple filters
- Health‑minded users who appreciate quick nutrition estimates

Key things you can do
- Add ingredients in two ways:
  - Type them in (e.g., “tomato, rice, chicken”).
  - Upload a photo of your ingredients; the app recognizes common items.
- Apply filters to match your needs:
  - Dietary: vegetarian, vegan, gluten‑free, etc.
  - Cooking time: choose a maximum time.
  - Difficulty: easy, medium, or hard.
- Adjust serving size and see ingredient amounts and nutrition scale automatically.
- Browse multiple recipe options ranked by how well they match your ingredients.
- See missing items and suggested substitutions to help you improvise.
- Save recipes as favorites and rate them (your choices improve suggestions over time).

What you’ll see in a recipe
- Title, cuisine, difficulty, time, and servings
- Ingredient list (with optional items and possible substitutions)
- Step‑by‑step instructions
- Nutrition snapshot (calories, protein, carbs, fat)

Tips for best results
- Include staple items you have (e.g., “rice, onion, tomato, eggs”).
- If recognition from a photo misses something, add it manually.
- Use substitutions when you’re missing one ingredient—great for quick swaps.

Privacy and data
- Image recognition runs in your browser; photos are not uploaded to a server for analysis.
- Your favorites and ratings are stored only in your browser (on this device).

Questions?
